DOM - Document Object Model:
this is a structured representation of HTML Doc.
we can thing about it like tree of nodes (elements) that created by the browser.
we can use JS to manipulated this DOM.
the DOM is object oriented (OO Class) which mean we can use a set of properties and method that related to it and we can use. (change/add/remove...)
we have a object window and its sub-class is the Document.
the Document sub-class is the HTML root, afterwards there are all of the other tags that we proggramet wrote. (we can see the tree in the file "What is the DOM.png")

Whats next? go upwards to the sections folder to section of DOM (section 3) starts with the 3_2_Examining_The_Document_Object
